One of the challenges, anyone developing an e-commerce based app faces, is
that an order cart has to be validated before it is considered to be a
legitimate order and inserted into the database. This validation is extensive
and thorough, in that it has to verify a number of things including: the cart
items are actual products, the prices of the cart items are valid, the order
total is valid, etc.

In this question, we'll be focusing on one particular part of this cart
validation journey; the validation of a cart item's ordered quantity. We have
a specific amount of inventory for each product. We're receiving requests for
Orders to be placed for the same products, by different users, at the same
time. While validating the cart, we check if the ordered quantity is available
for that particular product. And if there is, we let the order go through.

Do you see any problems with this logic? If there is, mention that problem
and also a fix or it. If there isn't, mention why.

Be as thorough or as precise as you want. The only thing we're looking to
gather from your answers is that it is clear enough for us to understand
properly.
